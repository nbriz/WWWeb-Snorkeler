# WWWeb-Snorkeler install guide!

HEY! thnx for downloading the WWWeb Snorkeler browser add-on! here's how u get it installed. Also: this only works with (Firefox)[https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/], so if u don't already have that browser go download it, it's the best!

1. open the (Add-ons)[about:addons] tab by:
	* click the menu icon near the top right of the browser && then click "Add-ons" or 
	* click on the "Tools" menu then choose "Add-ons" or 
	* simply type about:addons into ur address bar

2. when in the Add-ons tab click the gear on the top right corner of the page ( to the left of the search box ) && then click on "Install Add-on From File..." option

3. then choose the wwweb_snorkeler .xpi file u downloaded alongside this README file && ur good to go :D 


NOTES:

make sure u refresh any tabs that were open prior to having installed the Add-on before it'll work properly. if u have any issues/bugs/comments leave them on the (WWWeb Snorkeler's github issues page)[https://github.com/nbriz/WWWeb-Snorkeler/issues]
