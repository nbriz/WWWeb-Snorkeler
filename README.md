# How To / Why Make Internet Art

...is a hypermedia series ( interactive video and Firefox addon ) that approaches basic web literacy ( HTML/CSS/JavaScript ) as a contemporary art form ( for makers, designers and creators ) The series positions the web platform as the ultimate artist studio/gallery, frames these technologies as environments rather than simply tools and stresses the importance of introducing a diversity of perspectives into the conversations shaping our digital/networked ecology.
